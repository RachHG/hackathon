# Task 4: Adapt Harmony to other domains

We have developed Harmony initially with psychological instruments in mind.

However we suspect that it could be used for many other domains, such as:

* market research surveys and questionnaires (e.g. "to what extent does this new logo suit our offering / somewhat agree etc?")
* medical history forms

Harmony by default tries to assign questionnaire items to mental health categories such as "anxiety" and "depression" by checking the nearest vector match to items in the Mental Health Catalogue. If we make a new "flavour" of Harmony for a different domain, what would we use as our data dictionary in this case?

I have provided some examples of medical history forms in this folder:
